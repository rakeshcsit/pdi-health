<p>Hi <%= @audit.instructor.instructor %>, <%= @s.ss %>, <%= @r.rd %></p>

<p><%= @audit.instructor.instructor %>, we analyzed your class recording and noted down your metrics and compared them to our target metrics of excellent instruction.</p>

<p>Additionally, we provided notes on why we gave you those particular scores, and provided you information that could help you improve.</p>

<p>We will be conducting audits on your teaching in the future and our hope is for you to take this feedback and improve.</p>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>

  <p> We saw that you <span class="notOptimal padFive">did not establish objectives</span> for the students at the beginning of the lesson. This is important because the students need to know what success means for the day.</p>

  <p>All you have to do is slack them out to the students from the lesson plan and have unique students read each one, and after each student reads an objective, you make a brief comment.</p>
<% end %>

<% unless eqh("action_flag", @audit.action_flag, true) %>
  <h2>Action During Exercises</h2>

  <p>We believe <span class="notOptimal padFive">you did not walk around during exercises</span>.</p>

  <p>Walking around during exercises is very very very important. During exercises, you must look at as many screens as possible. If many students are struggling. Pause and give additional instruction. Make announcements during exercises based on what you're seeing on student screens.</p>

  <p>During exercises, ask if students are done, if they are then get them to help students that are not complete.</p>

  <p>When students listen to you - they're not thinking.</p>

  <p>By creating discussions, you force students to think about what you just went over.</p>

  <p>During a discussion, you walk around and hear what students are saying. You keep a log of questions, misconceptions and after the discussion, you answer the questions and kill the misconceptions for everyone to hear.</p>

  <p> Here are examples of discussions </p>

  <ul>
    <li>"3 minutes, Example to your partners lines 1-12 on the projector"</li>
    <li>"3 minutes, Explain to your partners why the code on the projector is wrong."</li>
    <li>"5 minutes, Explain to your partners how you would tackle what I did without a database."</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here are some examples of movement:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"Put both hands up if you think this will output to true."</li>
    <li>"Make an x across your chest if you think the div will be green."</li>
    <li>"Make a circle with your hands if you think this will yield an error."</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Examples of noise:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"If you think this will output to true, stomp your feet."</li>
    <li>"If you think this will break, clap your hands."</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Examples of unique tactics:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Instead of something boring like foo or hello world, ask: "Jennifer what did you do over the weekend"
      <br>

    Then you would update the example code to be var events = ["Jen watched all of breaking bad over the weekend"]

    <br>

    You would then ask another student the same question and add to that array.

  <p>Meaningful questions are around the understanding of the code.</p>

  <p>
    For example, if the code is about for loops, then a meaningless question is: "Eric, What's a variable?" A meaningful question would be: "Dana or Jeff, what happens if I change i to 1?" Or, "What happens if I change i++ to i--?"

    <li>Repeat concepts. This shouldn't be you repeating something 15 times. Instead it could be you saying something, then later asking someone a question about it. Then repeating yourself again later on, and then finally asking someone different about it.</li>
