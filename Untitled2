leetcode, code wars, interview cake, hacker rank, upwork (sign up and take the tests)

- share the style guide

I'm going to make next time much better.

Planning on having an app done so that you guys login and have all the questions right there, and fill out a survey on people that you're interviewing.

And I reached out to zoom support to figure out the microphone issue.

I'll set clear steps.
1. login at a url
2. click on demo problem
3. ...
4. i'm going to make breakout rooms for you to interview each other

- as an interviewer do the following things, don't do the following things
- click the share screen button at the bottom of the window when you're in the breakout room

- if your partner isn't present then leave the breakout room by pressing the button

I'll stay out of breakout rooms and reroute people

I couldnt get the application to download so Iâ€™m in the program through the browser.

[8:41]
Just FYI two of my students made the above statement for the tech prep session.  One of them was able to get in through his phone.

More feedback:
I wasn't able to join the group or see links

[9:55]
I think the app was bugged for me

[11:01]
Some of the students said they had issues to but they think it was the app.  Some were able to log out and log back in and it worked for them.

I enjoyed every bit of it.

Glad to hear that.

The experiences of the graduates did it for me. Its not all rosy but it is something to look forward to


how would you code a html form
  how would you validate it

if you got these errors what would you assume



explain the box model to me

explain what an anonymous function is

-> get help button (would you like to invite the host)

input output

if you had 0 to 2 million

go through all those numbers and add prime numbers

--------

go over how to use zoom - share screen, chat, etc

breakout rooms of 4
->

- cannot use google
- must live code with no help/looking up things
- must pass test cases

var testOne = {
  dog: 'woof woof',
  cat: 'meow meow'
};

var testTwo = {
  lion: 'roar roar',
  catDog: 'meow woof'
};

var testThree = {
  lion: 'roar roar',
  toughCategory: 'meow woof'
};

Make a function that will return true if an object has a key that is the word cat or contains the word cat.




establish clear rules

sample question:

test case:
var testOne = {
  dog: 'woof woof',
  cat: 'meow meow'
};

var testTwo = {
  lion: 'roar roar',
  catDog: 'meow woof'
};

var testThree = {
  lion: 'roar roar',
  toughCategory: 'meow woof'
};

Make a function that will return true if an object has a key that is the word cat or contains the word cat.
//that would work for testOne
function findInObj(obj, val){
  for (var key in obj){
    if ((key.toLowerCase()).indexOf(val.toLowerCase())){
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
}





test cases: 0 returns true, 3 returns false, 6 returns true
question: make a function that tells whether a number is even or not
bonus: make the code inside the function one line and do not use an if statement
bonus: don't use % (modulus)
level:
time: 10 minutes
time: 10 minutes to fill out the survey


we could do another one where we ask about the entire sentence

test cases: "apple" returns true, "bear" returns false.
question: make a function that tells whether the first letter is a vowel or not
bonus: make it work for any case of letter
bonus: code it in another way
bonus: make the code inside the function one line and do not use an if statement
or don't use indexOf
level:
time: 15 minutes
time: 10 minutes to fill out the survey
          //zoom session

          function isEven(number){
          if(number % 2 == 0){
          return true;
          };
          return false;
          };

          function firstLetVowel(string){

          var vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u'];

          var targetLetter = string[0].toLowerCase();

          for(var i=0; i<vowels.length; i++){

          if(targetLetter === vowels[i]){

            return true;

          }

          }

          return false;

          };

          function firstLetVowelAlt(string){
          var vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u'];
          return vowels.indexOf(string[0].toLowerCase())!=-1;
          };
          var testNum = 111;
          var testString = "Aklasdfjoieru";


          console.log(firstLetVowel(testString));
          console.log(firstLetVowelAlt(testString));
          console.log(isEven(testNum));


MySQL questions:

  create a database:
  write the sql to create a table with certain columns

  insert a record into the table
  update that record
  delete that recording
  drop the table
  drop the database

MongoDB questions:

  create a database:
  write the nosql to create a table with certain columns

  insert a record into the table
  update that record
  delete that recording
  drop the table

--- nested for loops ---
times table with a nested for loop
give json array to loop through


compare an array within an object ->

live code rock paper scissors

live coded tic tac toe
  -> do a console program no html

live coded hangman

check the user to see if the user got black jack



count the syntax errors they have

copy and paste the individual's code also
and choose the problem they did -> drop down


how does ajax work? how do you hit an api

how do you make an api?



- before giving a problem to students - always live code it with our internal academic team

1. did the test cases work
2. did they talk through the problem?
3. did they get frustrated?
3.1. did they ask for hints?
3.2. did they give up?
4. attitude?
light hearted, really bogged down
5. was the code indented properly
give examples
no spacing

bad indenting
no semicolons at the end
semicolons in weird places -> at the end of a for loop or a function
spaces after things

var i=0;i<vowels.length

using console.logs instead of returns

6. were proper variable/function names used?

evenCheck is a good name for a function that checks if a number is even.

doesSomething is a bad name for a function that checks if a number is even.

7. you need to use split but you forgot the name of split

so you use "apple".seperateIntoArray() instead of "apple".split("")

- this is better than saying I don't know what to do.

8. did they test their test cases before saying they were done

9. pseudo coding (writing out your steps) -> if the problem is complicated




--------------
It could be cool to have students that were struggling and took a while to get a job come talk after being placed


Ahmed - I think for these students, other than breaking the stigma and talking about how it can lead to a job they'd rather have - working on soft skills and how to marry their old job skills with dev skills to frame it as advantageous for the job in question
So go through like several different job descriptions like Tech Support and talk to them about what narrative they can develop with their previous experience, practice that on different positions.

don't stop coding
just keep going
you can't stop
never stop
learn new languages
learn new frameworks
here's some continuous stuff that you could have fun working on in the mean time


8 to 16 hours for each hw -> above average
