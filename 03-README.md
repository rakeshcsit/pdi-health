add senior ssms to relationships that will also be cc'd on analysis emails - let them know ahead of time - this is brett and alex (need to figure out which universities they're senior for)



add on audit email 
- this email took 4 hours to construct, please read it :)
- if you have questions, please email us back.



email reccomend instructor in a market to help another instructor - get coffee - here's their audit

email recommend TAs to help instructor increase question asking

target for analysts is 12 audits per week (3 per day)

uncheck instructors that are inactive - that we should not audit based on any number of reasons --> track this
-> so add active for instructors in migration and go through all the instructors and set them to true in the migration

instructors login to leopard to see all their audits, student metrics, interviews that students have went through
ratings that students gave - etc.


we should fields for the students to grade TAs

- let both SSMs and Rds update instructor information for their universities

- put pre quiz into leopard -> put the date

- you can see which instructors/tas that have not completed the quiz prior to the dry run

- bring in student data here and show the student data with the instructor data

ahmed -> capturing hw rates
show hw grade distribution
show hw feedback rate

sample plan we have for uncc
      Action Items:
      1. Communicate Student Thoughts to Terra
      2. Go over Pavan's Analysis with Terra
      3. Encourage her to really create a connection with students + encourage students to really ask a question. Let her know that she can break from script a bit to loosen it up.
      4. Encourage Tutoring with Greg
      5. Have Terra / Kevin attend each other's classes once.  
      6. Academic Team to Watch Feedback on Terra's class closely
      7. Get second screen for Terra
      8. Show output of code as he goes well (screen management)
      9. Steven to boost feedback



do you have a second screen
- top instructors use a second monitor or a second laptop so they can

- "do the activity and make sure the other person got it"



Seanâ€™s his co-instructor

[10:58]  
we need to put those relationships into the app (edited)

[10:59]  
so if we see that an instructor is weak but the co is strong

[10:59]  
we can get the strong to help

Dan: on audit show - change the labels and values to not be double negatives

create api keys and documentation for the api

remove big flag from audit show and throw it at the top of the report

create filtering so you can take out certain parts of the audit on the show page to email out to someone.

PUT IN A FLAG to not show it to the instructor
  flag instructors that should not receive feedback - email will still go out but won't include the instructor's name

  - a note on the emails will be put there -

show nation average for the lesson plan if we have it and overall


encouragement flag - instructor that needs lots of positive encouragement


6. tier updates need to be visible when editing an instructor

8. bulk reporting for rds and ss

list of dates and audits per date

never do saturday classes (not always 1.3,2.3) never do 1.1
