pay it forward for interview prep

bring in students that got placed
  -> talk about the interviews
  -> have students go through those questions
  -> have those students come back to talk about their experience on the job
  -> what you wish you did before the job

YouTube videos around interviews

students would like to hear from students just like them and how to get that job and how to navigate the next part of their journey

-> also gives a confidence boost to students - because they can relate to alum speakers as opposed to senior devs/CTOs

Students don't sell themselves as well as they should

  tell me about yourself

  tell me about your experience with JS

    weak response

    it should be:

      I made 20+ applications in the last 6 months ranging from front end, full stack, etc...

      I taught myself blah blah blah

Brett: "What not to do on an interview - my worst interview event"

Brett: Checklist of some sort
  - questions you should be able to do perfect going into interview
  - could be a wikipedia like article - that all students add to and contribute to


Ahmed: diagnostic tests



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
do the students know who is interviewing them?

if so then you should find them on linkedin, you should see their githubs, look at their recent commits, piece together their schools

your piecing together a narrative of your interviewer

if you know who your interviewer is then you know how to speak to them better (you're not going to inundate them with facts don't matter to them)
